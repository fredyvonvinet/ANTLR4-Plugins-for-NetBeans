OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <p>NetBeans plugins for ANTLR 4 enabling to integrate ANTLR grammar files in standard NetBeans projects (ant-based or Maven-based).\
    </p>\n\n<p>This plugin offers next functionalities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ANTLR 4 grammar file and token file integration (specific icons),</li>\n<li>ANTLR 4 language integration of these files (enables NetBeans to launch on-the-fly color editing and syntax / checking tasks),</li>\n<li>color editing of grammar and token files that is mainly lexical-oriented but contains as well some syntax-oriented recognitions and colorings (based on an ANTLR 4 lexer),</li>\n<li>code folding of multi-line comments and actions (deployed in more than 3 lines) in grammar files</li>\n<li>hyperlink on token and parser rule references</li>\n<li>a syntax checker (of course, based on an ANTLR 4 parser and an ANTLR 4 listener),</li>\n<li>a semantic checker (of course based on the previous ANTLR 4 parser, an ANTLR 4 walker and an ANTLR 4 listener),</li>\n<li>error badging propagation through project nodes,</li>\n<li>ANTLR 4 code generation integration in project ant build script with a new antlr4 task (for ant-based projects), integration of ANTLR 4 Maven plug-in and its dependency in POM file (for Maven-based).\
    </li>\n<li>deployment of complete and runtime ANTLR 4 libraries in Netbeans library repository (usefull only for ant-based projects).\
    </li>\n<li>hyperlinks in output window pointing to errors in source code</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For deploying ANTLR 4 project resource into a project, select the project where you want to include ANTLR 4 grammar files and select the next menu "File/Add ANTLR support to project". \
    You should see a new report tab in NetBeans output window dedicated to ANTLR plugin showing what tasks the plugin have done with success or not.\
    </p>\n\n<p>Currently, project integration only supports Java standard Edition project (ant-based or Maven-based). \
    In fact, it is not a limitation because it is a good practice :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to develop your grammar in such an environment as a simple library project,</li>\n<li>and then, after your grammar has been completely validated, to integrate your new library in your target project (standard edition, Enterprise Edition, etc).\
    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All other functionalities work on all types of project.\
